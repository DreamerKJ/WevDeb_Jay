# Week 6 (Thu) Notes

> Random Discovery

Apparently ```git add *``` and ```git add -A``` do different things? The former is a *shell* command and therefore doesn't know about deleted files, and the latter is a *git* command and knows about it. Best to use the latter most of the time.

**Isn't git great? :)**
