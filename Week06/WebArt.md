Currency has always struck me as a fascinating, precarious concept. One that seemingly wasn't confined to just me, as Cheang in "Garlic=Rich Air" imagines the *far* future of 2030, where the fall of capitalism has left the humanity only one recourse for functioning currency, garlic. Participants partook in a world where digital goods, in this case- website urls, could be exchanged for a digital currency- virtual garlic. The work would later take on a physical component as well, as a truck drove around NYC, exchanging said v-garlic for actual real garlic, the New York Stock Exchange included in one of its stops.

It's a hauntingly familar concept, both the concept of digital currency- although far less environmentally damaging, and the idea of treating a digital string of data as a product that was unique and could be sold and bought. In fact, this work predates the *Million Dollar Homepage* by a few years, which I had always thought was one of the first cases where digital real estate first began to blossom as an idea.
