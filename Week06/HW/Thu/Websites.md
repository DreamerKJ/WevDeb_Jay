> I mostly like their website, but I don't really like their navigation bar. There's too many there, and they are laid out in a visually uninteresting and cluttering way. That said, I really like the small animations for all of their content when you click on the menus.

> Just a really good and concise website.

> I really don't like how their navigation bar is laid out. The information hierarchy is weird, and all of their menu have different interactions. That said, I really really like how in all of their product pages, the gallery part scrolls really fast while the right side goes slow so it makes you look at all the photos even when you're getting to the buttons, but it doesn't feel annoying or weird.
